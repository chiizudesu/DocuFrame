  Company tax return

  From a tax perspective, there is taxable income in the Company of ${{taxable_income}}. Tax on this amount is ${{tax_amount}}. After accounting for tax credits on investment income and provisional tax paid during the year, the Company is due to receive a refund of ${{tax_refund}}/has tax to pay of ${{tax_payable}}. This is due for payment on 7 April 2026 and we will be in touch closer to the due date with our standard reminder letter.
