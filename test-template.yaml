  Dear {{client_name}},

  I hope this email finds you well. I have completed the review of your financial documents and wanted to provide you with a summary of my findings.

  Based on the financial statement provided, I can see that {{financial_summary}}.

  Additionally, from your tax return, I note that {{tax_summary}}.

  Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to schedule a meeting to discuss these findings in more detail.

  Best regards,
  {{accountant_name}}
