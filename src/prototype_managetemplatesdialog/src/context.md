## Component Interface
- `TemplateManager`
  - `isOpen: boolean` - Controls the visibility of the modal.
  - `onClose: () => void` - Callback function to close the modal.
  - `templateName: string` - The name of the template.
  - `templateContent: string` - The content of the template.
  - `placeholders: { name: string, description?: string }[]` - List of placeholders with optional descriptions.
  - `onSave: () => void` - Callback function to handle saving the template.
  
Default values: None specified. Recommended prop combination should include `isOpen` with `onClose` for modal functionality.

## Exported Components
- `TemplateManager`

## Usage Examples
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { ComponentPreview } from './ComponentPreview';

const App = () => (
  <ComponentPreview />
);

export default App;
```

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { TemplateManager } from './TemplateManager';

// Example usage
const ExampleModal = ({ isOpen, onClose }) => (
  <TemplateManager
    isOpen={isOpen}
    onClose={onClose}
    templateName="Sales Report"
    templateContent="Total Sales: {{revenue}}"
    placeholders={[{ name: '{{revenue}}' }]}
    onSave={() => console.log('Template saved!')}
  />
);
```

## Design Guidelines
- Use consistent spacing based on Chakra UI's spacing scale for elements.
- Recommended color scheme should align with Chakra UI defaults, utilizing light and dark modes for accessibility.
- Typography should utilize Chakra's typography scale, maintaining a clear visual hierarchy with headings and body text distinct.
- Ensure responsive design by using `VStack` and flexible width settings for components.
- Accessibility best practices include using proper ARIA labels for buttons and modals.

## Styling & Behavior
- Key styling props include those controlled by Chakra UI, such as `bg`, `colorScheme`, and `size`.
- Important interactive states include hover and focus styles provided by Chakra's default button styles.
- The modal will adjust its size based on the viewport, ensuring a responsive design.
- Dark/light mode behavior should be adequately covered by using `useColorModeValue` for background and text colors.
- Edge cases such as zero placeholders should be handled by conditional rendering in the UI.

## Integration Notes
- No specific CSS variables are required; Chakra UI's built-in theming can be leveraged.
- Ensure that ChakraProvider is wrapped around components that utilize Chakra's components for proper theming.
- Common patterns include utilizing modal components for user input forms, keeping UX consistent with modal usage.

## Best Practices
- Always define `onClose` for modals to ensure they can be dismissed appropriately.
- Avoid complex state logic; keep UI state management simple and close to component definitions.
- When handling forms, consider using libraries like Formik for managing form state and validation.
- Optimize for performance by memoizing components when necessary, especially when passing large datasets as props.
- Testing recommendations include writing unit tests for user interactions and rendering key component states such as loading and success scenarios.
